# Module-01-Challenge

## Description

As a student in the Bootcamp program, I was tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS of this website. Various elements were modified to create a more accessible website.

I used semantic HTML, fixed a link, added values as requested, and added alt tags where necessary.
